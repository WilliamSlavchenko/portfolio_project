# portfolio_project
This is an unholy piece of a web app that I'm currently working on to prepare to a coding meetup. I'm making this repo to save my progress before I make changes to the main files.
Currently I'm afraid of making irreversible frankestein-esque mistakes that may break everything in my project just because I want it to have animations on scroll. Fingers crossed that it'll work out.
